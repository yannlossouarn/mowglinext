// Simple boustrophedon coverage planner on Fields2Cover v3 — separated from
// coverage_server.cpp so it can be unit-tested against the real F2C library
// without standing up the ROS action server (test/test_coverage_planning).
//
// Design (2026-06-12 re-implementation, after two days of fighting turn
// planners): the robot is a diff-drive that PIVOTS IN PLACE, so the coverage
// plan contains NO turn geometry at all. F2C contributes exactly three things:
//   1. ConstHL::generateHeadlandSwaths — N concentric headland rings (mowed,
//      outermost first),
//   2. ConstHL::generateHeadlands     — the mainland left inside the rings,
//   3. BruteForce + BoustrophedonOrder — straight serpentine swaths over the
//      mainland (each disjoint clip of a sweep line is its OWN swath, so
//      concave boundaries and interior holes are handled without
//      decomposition — verified in F2C v3 Swaths::append).
// The output is a list of explicit, ordered, individually-drivable segments.
// Turns between segments are the navigation stack's job (RotationShim in-place
// pivot + MPPI straight tracking), NOT F2C's: every prior design that let F2C
// plan turns (Dubins Ω-loops, CC-Dubins arcs, Reeds-Shepp cusps) produced
// geometry this chassis could not track, and the downstream heading-jump
// re-segmentation heuristic silently failed on the smooth arcs.

// Flatten a BoustrophedonPlan into ONE continuous, cusp-free, in-bounds
// polyline so an MPPI-class sampling controller can track it without the
// bimodal dither/spin it does at sharp ~180° reversals.
//
// The robot drives the plan as: all rings (densified closed loops, outermost
// first) then all swaths (straight start→end, serpentine order). Reversals
// occur (a) between consecutive concentric rings, (b) at every swath U-turn,
// and as a big jump between the last ring and the first swath. At each such
// transition this inserts a smooth FORWARD turn-around connector: a forward-
// only Dubins path (fixed `turn_radius`, no reversing) tangent to the previous
// segment's exit heading and the next segment's entry heading, so there is NO
// cusp at the junction. For a ~180° reversal at ~op_width spacing this yields
// the expected teardrop / Ω loop into the already-mowed (headland) side. Of the
// six forward Dubins words (LSL/RSR/LSR/RSL/RLR/LRL) the SHORTEST whose sampled
// arc stays inside `boundary` (via pointInRing) is chosen, so the loop curls
// toward the mowed side that keeps it in-bounds. Re-mowing on the connectors is
// expected and accepted.
//
// If no full-radius connector fits in-bounds, `turn_radius` is shrunk for that
// connector — but NEVER below `min_turn_radius`. A loop tighter than the robot's
// minimum trackable turning radius is untrackable (wz≈vx/r exceeds the
// controller's authority), so MPPI loops/hesitates instead of driving it. If no
// arc of radius >= min_turn_radius fits in-bounds, a straight connector is used
// as a last resort (an out-of-bounds straight join is then a real, reportable
// gap — not silently clipped). The same floor caps the corner-fillet radius, so
// the whole path is free of sub-min_turn_radius arcs.
