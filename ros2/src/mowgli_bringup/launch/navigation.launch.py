navigation.launch.py

Navigation stack launch file for the Mowgli robot mower.

Brings up:
  1. robot_localization dual-EKF — ekf_odom (wheels + gyro → odom→base_footprint
     TF, continuous) and ekf_map (+ GPS via navsat_transform → map→odom
     correction). Sub-cm σ_xy under RTK-Fixed.
  2. Three helper nodes — dock_yaw_to_set_pose (seeds both EKFs with the dock
     heading on the is_charging rising edge), cog_to_imu (GPS COG as a
     continuous absolute-yaw observation with adaptive covariance), and
     mag_yaw_publisher (tilt-compensated LIS3MDL magnetometer yaw, gated on
     /ros2_ws/maps/mag_calibration.yaml existing).
  3. Nav2 bringup — full navigation stack (controllers, planners, recoveries,
     BT navigator, costmaps, lifecycle).

Architecture (REP-105):
  map → (ekf_map | fusion_graph) → odom → (ekf_odom) → base_footprint
                                                       → base_link → sensors
  ekf_map (default) fuses /gps/pose_cov (from navsat_to_absolute_pose_node,
  datum + lever-arm corrected) as pose0. fusion_graph (opt-in, see
  CLAUDE.md "Architecture Invariants" §1) is a 1-for-1 GTSAM iSAM2
  replacement that adds LiDAR scan-matching + loop-closure factors
  to ride through multi-minute RTK-Float windows; toggle with
  `use_fusion_graph:=true` (or persistently in mowgli_robot.yaml).
  The two are mutually exclusive — only one ever owns map→odom.
  slam_toolbox / Kinematic-ICP / FusionCore have all been removed;
  see CLAUDE.md "What NOT to Do" for the deprecated paths.
