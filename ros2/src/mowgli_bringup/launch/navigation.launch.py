navigation.launch.py

Navigation stack launch file for the Mowgli robot mower.

Brings up:
  1. Localization — fusion_graph_node (GTSAM iSAM2 factor graph) owns
     both map→odom AND odom→base_footprint. Map-frame inputs: wheel +
     IMU + GPS + COG (+ optional LiDAR scan-matching and loop-closure).
     Local-frame: wheel vx + gyro_z integrated at IMU rate (replaces
     the standalone robot_localization ekf_odom_node).
  2. Two helper nodes — cog_to_imu (GPS COG as a continuous absolute-
     yaw observation with adaptive covariance) and mag_yaw_publisher
     (tilt-compensated LIS3MDL magnetometer yaw, gated on
     /ros2_ws/maps/mag_calibration.yaml existing).
  3. Nav2 bringup — full navigation stack (controllers, planners,
     recoveries, BT navigator, costmaps, lifecycle).

Architecture (REP-105):
  map → odom → base_footprint → base_link → sensors
  fusion_graph_node owns both map→odom AND odom→base_footprint.
  It runs WITHOUT LiDAR when use_scan_matching=false AND
  use_loop_closure=false — the graph is then just a Pose2 backbone
  with wheel between-factors, gyro between-factors, and GNSS
  lever-arm + COG / mag unaries; local-frame DR is still produced
  from the same wheel + gyro stream.
  ekf_map_node, ekf_odom_node, slam_toolbox, Kinematic-ICP, and
  FusionCore have all been removed — see CLAUDE.md "What NOT to Do"
  for deprecated paths.

    # dock_yaw_to_set_pose was inlined into fusion_graph_node

    # pose anchor is now applied directly by the localizer on
    # is_charging rising edge, without a separate node + topic round-trip.

    # Publishes GPS course-over-ground as a synthetic sensor_msgs/Imu on
    # /imu/cog_heading so ekf_map_node can fuse it as an absolute-yaw
    # observation. Once the session is seeded and the robot is driving
    # forward faster than min_speed_ms with RTK-Fixed, this node corrects
    # gyro drift every /gps/absolute_pose sample.
    # cog_to_imu publishes a stationary "anchor" yaw at
    # stationary_seed_rate_hz Hz when GPS COG cannot be derived
    # (robot not moving forward). On real hardware this anchors the
    # fusion_graph yaw across long stationary periods. In sim with
    # KinematicDrive (which teleports without forward GPS motion),
    # the anchor pins ekf_map_node's yaw to a stale value and fights
    # the gyro integration, so a robot in PRE_ROTATE never closes
    # large heading errors (issue #200). Default 2.0 Hz, overridden
    # to 0.0 in sim_full_system.launch.py.
