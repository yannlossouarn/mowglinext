# MowgliNext

Open-source autonomous robot mower monorepo. ROS2 Kilted, Nav2, robot_localization (dual EKF: local wheel+gyro, global +GPS, under `two_d_mode`) — with an opt-in GTSAM iSAM2 factor-graph localizer (`fusion_graph`, in `ros2/src/fusion_graph/`) that 1-for-1 replaces `ekf_map_node` when `use_fusion_graph:=true` and adds optional LiDAR scan-matching + loop-closure factors. BehaviorTree.CPP v4, cell-based strip coverage. (`docs/HANDOFF_FUSION_GRAPH.md` is historical — kept around as the migration record but **not** the steady-state reference; see [`wiki/Architecture.md`](https://github.com/cedbossneo/mowglinext/wiki/Architecture#optional-factor-graph-localizer-fusion_graph) for current behaviour.)

## Safety — READ FIRST

This robot has spinning blades. The STM32 firmware is the sole blade safety authority.

- NEVER bypass firmware blade safety checks from ROS2
- Blade commands from ROS2 are fire-and-forget — firmware decides whether to execute
- Emergency stop is handled by firmware, not software
- Flag ANY change that could affect physical behavior as safety-critical in PR reviews

## Architecture Invariants (DO NOT VIOLATE)

1. **Localizer is in transition: robot_localization (dual EKF) by default, fusion_graph (GTSAM) opt-in.** `ekf_odom_node` always runs and publishes `odom → base_footprint` (wheel twist + IMU gyro_z under `two_d_mode`, tight `vy≈0` covariance enforces non-holonomic motion). For the map frame, two backends exist:
    - **Default (`use_fusion_graph:=false`)**: `ekf_map_node` fuses wheel + IMU + `/gps/pose_cov` (`pose0`, from `navsat_to_absolute_pose_node` with datum from `mowgli_robot.yaml` and lever-arm correction) + `/imu/cog_heading` (GPS course-over-ground yaw, `cog_to_imu.py`) + `/imu/mag_yaw` (when calibrated) and publishes `map → odom`. RTK-Fixed σ ~3 mm flows through as-is.
    - **Opt-in (`use_fusion_graph:=true`, see `ros2/src/fusion_graph/`)**: a GTSAM iSAM2 factor-graph node replaces `ekf_map_node` 1-for-1 — same inputs, same outputs (`map → odom` TF + `/odometry/filtered_map`), Pose2 graph at 10 Hz with custom `GnssLeverArmFactor` (analytic Jacobian), wheel between-factor with non-holo covariance, gyro between-factor on yaw, COG/mag yaw unary factors. **LiDAR scan-matching between-factors and loop-closure factors are wired** and gated by `use_scan_matching` / `use_loop_closure`; they let the map-frame estimate ride through multi-minute RTK-Float windows. Adds `/fusion_graph/diagnostics` (1 Hz `DiagnosticArray` with `total_nodes / loop_closures / scan_matches_ok|fail / cov_xx|yy|yawyaw`), `/fusion_graph/markers` (transient_local viz), `/imu/fg_yaw` (yaw-only output), and the services `~/save_graph` + `~/clear_graph` (both `std_srvs/Trigger`, surfaced in the GUI's Diagnostics → Fusion Graph panel).

   **slam_toolbox, Kinematic-ICP, and FusionCore are gone.** The previous RTK-fallback architecture (parallel TF tree, `slam_pose_anchor_node` EWMA, `wheel_odom_tf_node`, `slam_scan_frame_relay`, `slam_map_persist_node`, `rtk_pose_mux_node`, fusion as `pose1`), the K-ICP encoder adapter, and the FusionCore 22D UKF were all removed in favor of the factor-graph approach. `fusion_graph` is the only LiDAR-aware localizer; the `kinematic_icp` and `fusioncore` submodules are no longer part of the build.
2. **TF chain follows REP-105** — `map → odom → base_footprint → base_link → sensors`. `map→odom` is published by `ekf_map_node` and `odom→base_footprint` by `ekf_odom_node`. All Nav2 nodes use `base_footprint` as the robot frame. `base_link` is at the rear wheel axis (OpenMower convention, do not move).
3. **Cyclone DDS** — not FastRTPS (stale shm issues on ARM)
4. **Map frame = GPS frame** — X=east, Y=north, no rotation transform
5. **Costmap obstacles disabled in coverage mode** — collision_monitor handles real-time avoidance
6. **dock_pose + tool_width live in `mowgli_robot.yaml`** — single source of truth. `dock_pose_x/y/yaw`: `calibrate_imu_yaw_node`'s dock pre-phase and `/map_server_node/set_docking_point` (called by the GUI to manually pin the dock to the current robot pose) both write back to `mowgli_robot.yaml` via line-splice updates that preserve comments. `hardware_bridge`, `map_server`, and `dock_yaw_to_set_pose` read the values as ROS parameters. There is no `dock_calibration.yaml` anymore. `tool_width` (effective blade cut width): `navigation.launch.py` flows the same scalar into `map_server.tool_width` (mark_cells_mowed stamp radius + sliver detection) AND `coverage_server.operation_width` (F2C `Robot::setCovWidth`, controls swath spacing). The two used to be configured separately (`mower_width=0.18` + static `operation_width=0.20`), which left thin un-mowed strips between adjacent F2C swaths because map_server's stamp radius was narrower than F2C's spacing.
7. **Multi-area coverage = F2C-per-area + cell-based strip fallback.** `map_server_node` owns area polygons and the `mow_progress` grid layer. BT outer loop `GetNextUnmowedArea` iterates areas; per area, `PlanCoverageArea` calls `map_server_node/get_remaining_area_polygon` (returns the area's outer ring + `mow_progress` holes via Boost.Geometry difference) and forwards it to `mowgli_coverage`'s `compute_coverage_path` action (Fields2Cover v2.0); `FollowStrip` then feeds the resulting `nav_msgs/Path` to `FollowCoveragePath` (FTCController). On follow failure (collision wedge, FTC abort), `RetryUntilSuccessful` re-ticks `FollowStrip` on the SAME path (FTC's `setPlan` resyncs to the closest pose) — no replan loops. The legacy on-demand strip planner (`~/get_next_strip` + `GetNextStrip` BT node) still exists in `map_server_node` as a fallback path generator and for the `mow_progress` cell stamping; F2C is the live planner. Progress persisted in the `mow_progress` grid layer (survives restarts). Coverage status via `~/get_coverage_status` service and `/map_server_node/coverage_cells` OccupancyGrid.
8. **FTCController for coverage paths, FTC for transit too** — Both `FollowPath` and `FollowCoveragePath` slots use the FTCController plugin (single source of truth for tuning). RPP is gone from the active stack. MPPI was rejected for coverage because its Euclidean nearest-point matching jumps between adjacent swaths.
9. **Emergency auto-reset on dock** — When emergency is active and robot is on dock (charging detected), BT auto-sends `ResetEmergency` to firmware. Firmware is sole safety authority and only clears latch if physical trigger is no longer asserted.
10. **Undock via Nav2 BackUp behavior** — BackUp (1.5m, 0.15 m/s) via `behavior_server`, not `opennav_docking` UndockRobot (isDocked() unreliable with GPS drift near the dock). Costmaps are cleared after undock.
11. **Zero-odom only when charging AND idle** — `hardware_bridge_node` does not reset odometry during undock sequence.
12. **Battery current for dock detection** — Hardware bridge publishes `abs(charging_current)` when charging, `0.0` when not, for `SimpleChargingDock` compatibility.
13. **Docking server cmd_vel** — Remapped to `/cmd_vel_docking` through twist_mux (priority 15).
14. **Coverage grid_map → OccupancyGrid convention** — easy to get wrong. `grid_map::GridMap::getSize()(0)` = cells along X, `getSize()(1)` = cells along Y. grid_map iterates with `r=0 → X_max` (decreasing) and `c=0 → Y_max` (decreasing). `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid` has `width = X_cells`, `height = Y_cells`, row-major with `data[y_row * width + x_col]`, where `col=0 ↔ origin.x` (X_min) and `row=0 ↔ origin.y` (Y_min). To convert a grid_map cell `(r, c)` to an OccupancyGrid index: `og_col = nx - 1 - r`, `og_row = ny - 1 - c`, `flat_idx = og_row * nx + og_col`. ALWAYS set `mask.info.width = nx` and `mask.info.height = ny` — swapping produces a 90°-rotated mask, which silently marks valid interior polygon cells as lethal and breaks Smac planning with "Start occupied" errors. See `mow_progress_to_occupancy_grid()` in `map_server_node.cpp` as the reference implementation.

### Area Recording Flow
1. GUI sends `COMMAND_RECORD_AREA` (3) to start recording
2. BT enters `RecordArea` node — records position at 2 Hz, publishes live preview on `~/recording_trajectory`
3. User drives robot along boundary
4. GUI sends `COMMAND_RECORD_FINISH` (5) — trajectory is simplified (Douglas-Peucker) and saved via `/map_server_node/add_area`
5. Or GUI sends `COMMAND_RECORD_CANCEL` (6) — trajectory discarded

### Manual Mowing
- Dedicated BT state with `COMMAND_MANUAL_MOW` (7) — does not hijack recording mode
- Teleop via `/cmd_vel_teleop` (twist_mux priority)
- Blade managed by GUI (fire-and-forget to firmware)
- Collision_monitor, GPS, and the active map-frame localizer all remain active

## ROS2 Specifics

- **Distro:** Kilted
- **DDS:** Cyclone DDS (all containers share `docker/config/cyclonedds.xml`)
- **Topics:** Mowgli-specific topics under `/mowgli/` namespace
- **Frames:** `map` (global, GPS-anchored via fixed datum), `odom` (continuous local, dead-reckoning only — never jumps), `base_footprint` (robot frame for Nav2), `base_link` (rear axle), `lidar_link`, `imu_link`
- **TF chain:** `map→odom` (`ekf_map_node`, 30 Hz — absorbs GPS corrections), `odom→base_footprint` (`ekf_odom_node`, 50 Hz — continuous dead-reckoning), `base_footprint→base_link` (static), `base_link→sensors` (static — `base_link→imu_link` rotation = `imu_yaw/pitch/roll` from `mowgli_robot.yaml`, auto-calibratable via GUI button)
- **Units:** SI throughout (metres, radians, seconds)
- **Sensor fusion:** robot_localization dual EKF under `two_d_mode`. `ekf_odom_node` (25 Hz, wheel + gyro_z, publishes `odom→base_footprint`), `ekf_map_node` (10 Hz, wheel + gyro + `/gps/pose_cov` (`pose0`) + `/slam/pose_cov` (`pose1`) + `/imu/cog_heading` + `/imu/mag_yaw`, publishes `map→odom`). Config in `ros2/src/mowgli_bringup/config/robot_localization.yaml`. Non-holonomic motion enforced by tight `vy` covariance in `/wheel_odom`. Absolute yaw for the map-frame EKF comes from `cog_to_imu_node.cpp` (GPS course-over-ground, gated on BOTH `wheel_omega` AND IMU `gyro_z` for `on_fix` and `republish_latched_when_stationary` — wheel-only gating let multi-degree COG yaw jumps slip through during PRE_ROTATE tight arcs, because the Gazebo diff-drive plugin under-reports `wheel.angular.z` while the IMU still sees real angular motion) and `mag_yaw_publisher.py` (tilt-compensated magnetometer yaw, when magnetometer is calibrated). The `hardware_bridge_node` runs a 20 s IMU bias calibration (`imu_cal_samples: 1000`) every time the robot docks, and logs the implied mounting pitch/roll so the operator can promote any >1° offset into `mowgli_robot.yaml` → `imu_pitch/imu_roll`.
- **Navigation:** FTCController (Follow-the-Carrot with 3-axis PID) for both `FollowPath` (transit) and `FollowCoveragePath` (coverage strips). Single plugin handles pivots and obstacle deviation natively. NOT MPPI (jumps between adjacent swaths). NOT RPP (the FollowCoveragePath slot was migrated off RPP — FTC's <10mm lateral accuracy is required for the swath-tiling to actually tile).
- **Coverage:** Two-package pipeline. `map_server_node` (`mowgli_map`) owns area polygons + the `mow_progress` grid layer; service `~/get_remaining_area_polygon` returns `outer_ring + mow_progress_holes` (Boost.Geometry difference). `coverage_server` (`mowgli_coverage`, action `compute_coverage_path`) runs the F2C v2.0 pipeline: `f2c::hg::ConstHL.generateHeadlands(width)` insets the planning field; `f2c::hg::ConstHL.generateHeadlandSwaths(cov_width, n_passes, dir_out2in=true)` emits N concentric perimeter rings (densified to 10 cm steps in our wrapper) prepended to the path so the headland gets mowed; `f2c::decomp::TrapezoidalDecomp` splits the inner field around interior holes; per sub-cell `f2c::sg::BruteForce` → `f2c::rp::BoustrophedonOrder` → `f2c::pp::PathPlanning(DubinsCurvesCC)`; `pp.planPathForConnection()` inserts continuous-curvature Dubins arcs between sub-cells (and between headland end / first sub-cell start). One `PlanCoverageArea` per area per session — no replan loops; on `FollowStrip` abort, `RetryUntilSuccessful` re-ticks the same path and FTC `setPlan` resyncs to the closest pose. F2C v2.0 lives at `/opt/fields2cover-200` (legacy v1.2.1 at `/opt/fields2cover-121` is on the global ld path, so `mowgli_coverage` sets explicit `INSTALL_RPATH`s to win the loader race).
- **Coverage goal-checker:** `coverage_goal_checker` is `mowgli_nav2_plugins/PathProgressGoalChecker` (NOT `StoppedGoalChecker` — that one fires on velocity stoppage and matches mid-traversal during FTC's PRE_ROTATE pivots, which would complete the action at <2% coverage). It subscribes to `<plugin_name>/global_plan` (= `/controller_server/FollowCoveragePath/global_plan`) and only fires when the robot has monotonically tracked >= `progress_threshold` (0.95) of path poses AND is within xy/yaw tolerance of the goal pose. Includes a `fallback_timeout_s` watchdog (5 s) for missing global_plan and an `n<=1` guard for degenerate paths.
- **Area Recording:** `RecordArea` BT node records trajectory at 2 Hz, Douglas-Peucker simplification, saves polygon via `/map_server_node/add_area`. Live preview on `~/recording_trajectory`.
- **Manual Mowing:** Dedicated BT state (COMMAND_MANUAL_MOW=7). Teleop via `/cmd_vel_teleop`, blade managed by GUI. Collision_monitor, GPS, robot_localization remain active.
- **Emergency Auto-Reset:** BT auto-resets emergency when robot placed on dock (charging detected). Firmware is safety authority.
- **GPS fusion:** `navsat_to_absolute_pose_node` reads `/gps/fix` (NavSatFix) and emits `/gps/pose_cov` (PoseWithCovarianceStamped in `map` frame) with covariance derived from `position_accuracy` and a lever-arm correction applied via the current EKF yaw. `ekf_map_node` fuses `/gps/pose_cov` as `pose0`. `/gps/absolute_pose` remains exposed for the GUI and BT. With RTK-Fixed (σ ~3 mm) and frequent updates, the EKF converges to fix precision without special-case outlier gating.
- **fusion_graph (opt-in replacement for `ekf_map_node`):** Set `use_fusion_graph:=true` on `navigation.launch.py` (or persistently in `mowgli_robot.yaml`, exposed in the GUI's *Settings → Localization* section) to replace `ekf_map_node` with `fusion_graph_node` (GTSAM iSAM2). Pose2 graph at 10 Hz; one node per `node_period_s`, with a wheel between-factor (non-holonomic σ_y << σ_x), a gyro between-factor on yaw, a custom `GnssLeverArmFactor` (analytic Jacobian — antenna lever-arm rotates with the node's yaw, so it couples to heading correctly), and unary yaw factors for COG and tilt-compensated mag. **LiDAR scan-matching between-factors and loop-closure factors are wired** (gated by `use_scan_matching` / `use_loop_closure`) — they let the map-frame estimate carry through multi-minute RTK-Float windows, which is why this design exists. Reads datum + lever-arm from `mowgli_robot.yaml` via `fusion_graph.launch.py`. Persists `<graph_save_prefix>.{graph,scans,meta}` (default `/ros2_ws/maps/fusion_graph.*`); auto-saves on RECORDING→IDLE, dock arrival, and every `periodic_save_period_s` (5 min) in AUTONOMOUS state. Surface: `/fusion_graph/diagnostics`, `/fusion_graph/markers`, `/imu/fg_yaw`, services `~/save_graph` + `~/clear_graph` (both `Trigger`).
- **IMU mounting calibration:** `base_link→imu_link` rotation (imu_roll, imu_pitch, imu_yaw in mowgli_robot.yaml) is critical — if wrong, gravity-removal leaks into pitch and yaw integration degrades. Use the GUI's "Auto-calibrate" button next to IMU Yaw — the robot drives itself ~0.6 m forward then back and solves `imu_yaw = atan2(-ay_chip, ax_chip)` from accel direction vs wheel-derived `a_body`.
- **Nav2 tuning:** Global costmap 30m x 30m rolling window; keepout_filter disabled in global costmap (blocks transit/docking); collision_monitor in coverage mode uses **PolygonSlow only** (`polygons: ["PolygonSlow"]` — PolygonStop kept firing whenever the chassis grazed a costmap obstacle while FTC tried to deviate, forcing PRE_ROTATE timeouts; obstacle avoidance during coverage is now FTC's `enable_obstacle_deviation` with `obstacle_lookahead: 30` (~1.5 m at F2C's 0.05 m sampling) + `max_lateral_deviation: 1.5`); source_timeout 5.0s (ARM TF jitter); PoseProgressChecker `required_movement_radius: 0.15` + `required_movement_angle: 0.5 rad` (counts rotation as progress so headland pivots don't trip "no progress"), `movement_time_allowance: 30s` default (operator-tunable via `progress_timeout_sec`); failure_tolerance 1.0; speeds default `transit 0.5 / mowing 0.5 m/s` (per-site overrides in `mowgli_robot.yaml`).
- **Joystick:** Foxglove client passes `schemaName` in `clientAdvertise` for JSON-to-CDR conversion. GUI shows joystick during "RECORDING" state (not just "AREA_RECORDING").

See sections below for detailed package descriptions, topics, and architecture.

## Git Workflow

**NEVER commit directly to main.** Always use feature branches and PRs:
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feat/my-feature    # or fix/, refactor/, test/, chore/, docs/
# ... make changes ...
git add <files> && git commit -m "feat: description"
gh pr create --title "feat: my feature" --body "..."
```

### Dev Branch Workflow

Docker builds trigger on both `main` and `dev` branches. Images are tagged `:main` and `:dev` respectively. Use `mowgli-dev` / `mowgli-main` commands to switch between environments. Iterate on `dev`, merge to `main` when stable.

## Quick Commands

All ROS2 commands assume you are inside the devcontainer.

```bash
# Build ROS2 workspace
cd ros2 && make build

# Build a single package
cd ros2 && make build-pkg PKG=mowgli_behavior

# Run headless simulation
cd ros2 && make sim

# Run E2E tests (simulation must be running in another terminal)
cd ros2 && make e2e-test

# Format C++ code
cd ros2 && make format

# Run unit tests
cd ros2 && make test

# Build firmware
cd firmware/stm32/ros_usbnode && pio run

# GUI development
cd gui && go build -o openmower-gui && cd web && yarn dev

# --- Code generation (run after changing .msg/.srv files) ---

# Regenerate firmware rosserial C++ headers from ROS2 .msg files
python3 firmware/scripts/sync_ros_lib.py          # writes to firmware/stm32/ros_usbnode/src/ros/ros_lib/mower_msgs/
python3 firmware/scripts/sync_ros_lib.py --check   # diff-only, no writes (CI)

# Regenerate Go message/service structs from ROS2 .msg/.srv files
cd gui && ./generate_go_msgs.sh                    # writes to gui/pkg/msgs/*/types_generated.go

# Regenerate TypeScript ROS types (snake_case fields matching rosbridge JSON)
cd gui && ./generate_ts_types.sh                   # writes to gui/web/src/types/ros.ts
```

### Code Generation Workflow

When you modify `ros2/src/mowgli_interfaces/msg/*.msg` or `srv/*.srv`:
1. **Firmware headers:** `python3 firmware/scripts/sync_ros_lib.py` — regenerates rosserial C++ headers
2. **Go types:** `cd gui && ./generate_go_msgs.sh` — regenerates Go structs with JSON tags for rosbridge
3. **TypeScript types:** `cd gui && ./generate_ts_types.sh` — regenerates `gui/web/src/types/ros.ts` with snake_case fields matching rosbridge JSON
4. **Protocol constants:** Update `HL_MODE_*` defines in `firmware/stm32/ros_usbnode/include/mowgli_protocol.h` AND `ros2/src/mowgli_hardware/firmware/mowgli_protocol.h` (these are manually maintained — keep in sync with `HighLevelStatus.msg`)

Do NOT hand-edit `*_generated.go`, `ros_lib/mower_msgs/*.h`, or `gui/web/src/types/ros.ts` — re-run the scripts instead.

## Mowing Session Monitoring

**Whenever a mowing test is run (COMMAND_START, undock, autonomous motion, or any tuning session that involves the robot moving), also run the session monitor in parallel.** Output is a JSONL timeline that can be diffed/plotted across sessions to see how tuning changes affect behavior.

```bash
# Detached background from the host (writes to /ros2_ws/logs/mow_sessions/
# inside the container, which is not mounted — better to bind-mount docker/logs/
# or redirect via --output-dir):
docker exec -d mowgli-ros2 bash -c '
  source /opt/ros/kilted/setup.bash && source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  python3 /ros2_ws/scripts/mow_session_monitor.py \
    --session 2026-04-29-fusion-graph-tuning-v1 \
    --output-dir /ros2_ws/maps'

# Interactively from inside the container (Ctrl-C to stop + write summary):
docker exec -it mowgli-ros2 bash -c '
  source /opt/ros/kilted/setup.bash && source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  python3 /ros2_ws/scripts/mow_session_monitor.py --session <name> \
    --output-dir /ros2_ws/maps'
```

The `--output-dir /ros2_ws/maps` redirects to the bind-mounted `install_mowgli_maps` Docker volume so logs persist outside the container. Or bind-mount `docker/logs/mow_sessions/` explicitly in compose for a host-visible path.

**What it records** (per-sample, 10 Hz default):
- Fused pose + twist from `/odometry/filtered_map` (x/y/z, yaw, vx/vy/wz) **+ position covariance (cov_xx, cov_yy, derived sigma_xy_m)**
- TF snapshots: `map→base_footprint` (composed through `map→odom→base_footprint`), `odom→base_footprint` (local EKF)
- Wheel twist + covariance + integrated distance and yaw
- IMU gyro + accel + integrated gyro yaw
- GPS NavSatFix (lat/lon/alt/status/covariance) + `/gps/absolute_pose` ENU
- Dock heading (`/gnss/heading` while charging)
- BT state (state_name, current_area, current_strip), hardware mode, emergency flags, battery
- `cmd_vel_nav` (Nav2 output) + `cmd_vel` (post-safety, what reaches motors)
- Nav2 `/plan` length, next pose, goal pose, distance-to-goal
- LiDAR scan health (valid point count, min range)
- Fusion graph stats (when `use_fusion_graph:=true`): pulled from `/fusion_graph/diagnostics` (node count, scan-match success rate, loop closures, marginal cov)
- **Cross-source consistency**: `fusion ↔ gps` distance, `wheel ↔ gyro` yaw drift, and (when `use_fusion_graph:=true`) `fusion ↔ scan-match` ICP success rate from `/fusion_graph/diagnostics`
- **RTK covariance-drop health**: on every RTK-Fixed GPS arrival, confirm `/odometry/filtered_map` cov drops to σ≤~3 cm within 300 ms — surfaced as `cross_checks.rtk_cov_check.{arrivals,ok,violations}` per sample and rolled into a `rtk_cov_check.verdict` ("healthy" / "intermittent" / "gate_rejecting" / "no_rtk") in the summary.

**Metadata header** (first line of the JSONL): session name, UTC timestamp, git branch + commit + dirty flag, docker image tags from `.env`, SHA-256 truncated hashes of `mowgli_robot.yaml`, `robot_localization.yaml`, `nav2_params.yaml` — so sessions from different tunings are grouped/comparable.

**Summary record** (last line, written on Ctrl-C or clean shutdown): total duration, samples written, wheel-integrated distance, straight-line displacement, peak `fusion↔gps` error, peak `wheel↔gyro` yaw drift, RTK cov-check totals + verdict, final BT state.

**Log directory:** `docker/logs/mow_sessions/<session_name>.jsonl`. Commit notable sessions (golden runs, failure cases) so they survive in git history.

## Recommended Skills and Agents

When using Claude Code on this project:

### Skills to Use
- `/ros2-engineering` — ROS2 node patterns, QoS, launch files, Nav2 (use for any ros2/ work)
- `/cpp-coding-standards` — C++ Core Guidelines (use for C++ reviews)
- `/docker-patterns` — Dockerfile and compose patterns (use for docker/ and sensors/ work)
- `/tdd` — Test-driven development (use when adding new features)

### Agents to Invoke
- **code-reviewer** — after any code changes
- **cpp-reviewer** — after C++ changes in ros2/
- **security-reviewer** — before commits touching auth, configs, or firmware commands
- **build-error-resolver** — when colcon or Docker builds fail
- **tdd-guide** — when implementing new features
- **architect** — for design decisions spanning multiple packages

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT add ROS1 patterns (rosserial, roscore, catkin) — this is ROS2 only
- Do NOT use FastRTPS — Cyclone DDS is required
- Do NOT mock the database/firmware in integration tests — use real interfaces
- Do NOT publish a `map→odom` TF from any node other than the active map-frame localizer. `map→odom` is owned by `ekf_map_node` (default) or `fusion_graph_node` (when `use_fusion_graph:=true`) — never both. The two are mutually exclusive in `navigation.launch.py`.
- Do NOT re-introduce slam_toolbox, Kinematic-ICP, or FusionCore. All three were tried and removed: slam_toolbox required a parallel TF tree + EWMA anchor + gating that was fragile across RTK-Float windows; K-ICP only gave a body-frame twist with no absolute-pose information; FusionCore's 22D UKF would not collapse σ_xy below ~30 cm even under RTK-Fixed. The factor-graph design (`fusion_graph`) is the replacement — LiDAR enters the same graph as scan-matching between/loop-closure factors (see `wiki/Architecture.md` § *Optional: Factor-Graph Localizer*).
- Do NOT send blade commands without firmware safety checks
- Do NOT hardcode GPS coordinates, dock poses, or NTRIP credentials
- Do NOT use MPPI controller for coverage paths — it jumps between swaths
- Do NOT use RPP for coverage paths — use FTCController for <10mm lateral accuracy on swaths
- Do NOT use `base_link` as robot_base_frame in Nav2/robot_localization — use `base_footprint` (REP-105)
- Do NOT use opennav_docking UndockRobot — use Nav2 BackUp behavior (isDocked() unreliable with GPS drift)
- Do NOT refer to `mower_width` — the param is `tool_width`, lives in `mowgli_robot.yaml`, and is the single source for both `map_server.tool_width` and `coverage_server.operation_width` (injected at launch). Reintroducing a separate `mower_width` will re-open the swath-spacing-vs-stamp-radius gap that caused 54 % coverage in 2026-05-12.
- Do NOT use `StoppedGoalChecker` for the `coverage_goal_checker` slot — use `mowgli_nav2_plugins/PathProgressGoalChecker`. StoppedGoalChecker fires on velocity stoppage and matches FTC's PRE_ROTATE pivots mid-traversal, completing the coverage action at <2 % coverage.
- Do NOT use the upstream `opennav_coverage` server. The repo carries it as a git submodule for the `opennav_coverage_msgs` action definitions only — every other subpackage (`opennav_coverage`, `_bt`, `_demo`, `_navigator`, `opennav_row_coverage`) is `COLCON_IGNORE`'d. The upstream server is pinned to F2C 1.2.1 (no `TrapezoidalDecomp`, no `generateHeadlandSwaths`, no `planPathForConnection`). Use `mowgli_coverage` (F2C 2.0.0).
- Do NOT call `buildHeadlandRingPath()` from the BT side — F2C v2 owns the headland traversal now (`generateHeadlandSwaths()` in `mowgli_coverage::CoverageServer::computeCoveragePath`). The BT-side prefix is only a small robot→F2C-start transit segment.
- Do NOT reintroduce the hardcoded sim test polygon into `ros2/src/mowgli_map/config/map_server.yaml`. A non-empty default makes a fresh real-robot install try to mow a phantom polygon at the GPS datum the moment `COMMAND_START` fires. The sim injects its polygon via `sim_full_system.launch.py` parameter override.
- Do NOT add a `locks:` block to `twist_mux.yaml` without first wiring a publisher in `hardware_bridge_node`. The earlier `/emergency_stop` lock was listening on a topic no node ever published; the real e-stop path is the `/hardware_bridge/emergency_stop` service which sets the firmware latch.
