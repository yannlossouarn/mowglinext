# Importing an OpenMower map into MowgliNext

> **Status: scaffolded preview, write path stubbed.**
> The Go importer parses + validates and the React UI shows a confirmation
> modal, but the write step (`/map_server_node/clear_map` → `add_area` →
> `save_areas` + `set_docking_point`) is intentionally disabled while we

This document specifies how a user can take a pre-existing OpenMower
1.x deployment (one of the many garden setups out there) and bring its
recorded mowing/navigation areas + docking station across to a fresh
MowgliNext install without re-driving the boundaries.

Two source formats are addressed:

1. **`map.json`** — the modern OpenMower map persistence format. Stable,
   self-describing, easy to parse. **Implemented** as a parse + preview
   path; the actual write is stubbed.
2. **`map.bag`** — the legacy ROS1 rosbag format that older OpenMower
   installs still have on disk. **Designed only**; deferred to a
   follow-up because pure-Go ROS1-bag readers are unmaintained and we
   would prefer a sidecar.

## 1. OpenMower `map.json` schema

Source of truth: `ClemensElflein/open_mower_ros` →
`src/mower_map/src/mower_map_service.cpp`. The JSON is produced via
`nlohmann::ordered_json` from these C++ structs:

```cpp
struct Point        { double x; double y; };
typedef std::vector<Point> Polygon;

struct MapArea {
  std::string id;        // 32-char nano-id
  std::string name;      // user-facing label, may be ""
  std::string type;      // "mow" | "nav" | "obstacle" | "draft"
  bool        active;    // omitted from JSON when true
  Polygon     outline;   // local x/y in metres, OpenMower map frame
};

struct DockingStation {
  std::string id;
  std::string name;       // "Docking Station" by default
  bool        active;
  Point       position;   // metres in the OpenMower map frame
  double      heading;    // radians, 0 = +x (east)
};

struct MapData {
  std::vector<MapArea>        areas;
  std::vector<DockingStation> docking_stations;
};
```

### Wire format example

        { "x":  0.0, "y":  0.0 }
      ]
    }

      "heading":  1.5707963267948966
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes on the structure that bit us in early prototypes:

- **Obstacles are flattened to top-level `MapArea`s with `type:"obstacle"`.**
  They are *not* nested inside the parent area as MowgliNext stores them.
  An obstacle has no parent reference in the JSON — it's an island
  polygon that must be matched back to a containing area by the
  importer (point-in-polygon).
- The `properties` envelope is optional. `name` is omitted when empty,
  `active` is omitted when `true`, so a freshly written area can collapse
  to `{ "id": "...", "properties": { "type": "mow" }, "outline": [...] }`.
- `type:"draft"` is the default for half-recorded areas — the importer
  treats `draft` as a soft warning and skips it (no MowgliNext analogue).
- `outline` is **not** closed. The first/last point are typically
  distinct; MowgliNext's `MapArea.area.points` doesn't require a closing
  point either.
- `docking_stations` is plural, but in practice OpenMower writes
  exactly one entry. The importer takes the first `active` station and
  warns if there are more.

### What is *not* in `map.json`

- **No datum.** OpenMower stores the geodetic datum (`OM_DATUM_LAT`,
  `OM_DATUM_LONG`) in `mower_config.sh` env vars, *not* in `map.json`.
  All polygon points are local metres in the OpenMower `map` frame
  anchored at that datum.
- **No frame metadata.** The frame is implied; it's flat ENU, X = east,
  Y = north (REP-103-aligned).
- **No timestamps**, no version field, no schema URL.

This means the importer **must** ask the user — or be told via an env
var — what OpenMower datum the points are anchored to. See
[§4 Coordinate frame handling](#4-coordinate-frame-handling).

## 2. Field-by-field mapping

| OpenMower (`map.json`)                              | MowgliNext target                                                        | Notes |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `area.properties.type == "mow"`                     | `MapArea` with `is_navigation_area=false`, `Obstacles=[]`                | Saved via `/map_server_node/add_area`. |
| `area.properties.type == "nav"`                     | `MapArea` with `is_navigation_area=true`, `Obstacles=[]`                 | Same service, flag flipped. |
| `area.properties.type == "obstacle"`                | `geometry_msgs/Polygon` appended to the parent area's `Obstacles`        | Parent found by point-in-polygon against the `mow` and `nav` areas. Obstacles outside any area are dropped with a warning. |
| `area.properties.type == "draft"`                   | dropped                                                                  | Warned. |
| `area.properties.name`                              | `MapArea.name`                                                           | Empty string → MowgliNext auto-names it (`mowing_area_<idx>`). |
| `area.properties.active == false`                   | dropped                                                                  | Inactive areas are not imported. |
| `area.outline[i].{x,y}`                             | `MapArea.area.points[i].{x, y}`, `z=0`                                   | After datum re-anchoring (see §4). |
| `docking_stations[0].position.{x,y}`                | `dock_pose_x`, `dock_pose_y` in `mowgli_robot.yaml`                      | After datum re-anchoring. |
| `docking_stations[0].heading`                       | `dock_pose_yaw` in `mowgli_robot.yaml`                                   | Already radians. The MowgliNext convention is identical (yaw 0 = +x = east, CCW positive), so no rotation flip is needed at the ENU level — but see §5 if the user is also rotating the map. |
| (no equivalent)                                     | `is_navigation_area` flag on obstacles                                   | MowgliNext stores obstacles per-area, OpenMower stores them globally. Reconstructed on import. |

The MowgliNext write-side surface (already exists, just not yet wired
to the importer):

- `PUT /api/mowglinext/map` — clear + bulk-insert all areas, calls
  `/map_server_node/clear_map`, then loops `/map_server_node/add_area`,
  then `/map_server_node/save_areas`.
- `POST /api/mowglinext/map/docking` — calls
  `/map_server_node/set_docking_point`, which line-splices `dock_pose_*`
  into `mowgli_robot.yaml` while preserving comments + perms.

The importer plans to call **exactly these two endpoints** from the Go
handler — no new ROS service surface is needed.

---

## 3. Coordinate frame handling

MowgliNext's `map` frame is ENU anchored at `(datum_lat, datum_lon)`
read from `mowgli_robot.yaml` (see `gui/pkg/api/diagnostics.go ::
extractYAMLFloat`). OpenMower's `map` frame is also ENU but anchored at
its own `(OM_DATUM_LAT, OM_DATUM_LONG)`.

There are three real-world cases:

### 3a. Same datum (the easy case)

User reuses the same RTK base station + the same configured datum →
**identity transform**. `(x_om, y_om) → (x_mn, y_mn) = (x_om, y_om)`.
Everything imports verbatim. The importer assumes this case by default
when the user does not provide an OpenMower datum on the upload.

### 3b. Different datum, same locale

User changed RTK base, or migrated the install. We need to translate
all points by the displacement between the two datums:

```
shift_east_m  = (lon_om - lon_mn) * cos(lat_mn * π/180) * METERS_PER_DEG
shift_north_m = (lat_om - lat_mn)                       * METERS_PER_DEG
METERS_PER_DEG = 111319.49079327357   # WGS84 1° at the equator, used by MowgliNext
```

(matches the constant in `gui/web/src/utils/map.tsx`). Then for every
point: `x_mn = x_om + shift_east_m`, `y_mn = y_om + shift_north_m`.

The importer will accept an optional `om_datum_lat` / `om_datum_lon`
form field on the upload. When provided, it computes the shift and
applies it. When omitted, it logs a warning and uses 3a (identity).

### 3c. Datum + bearing change (rare)

If the user is also rotating their world (e.g. they re-recorded the
dock heading, or they want their lawn aligned with magnetic north
instead of true north), a bearing rotation needs to be composed with
the translation. **Not in scope** for the first import iteration. The
GUI's existing **Map offset / bearing** panel is the manual escape hatch
for this case.

### Lat/lon round-trip

The actual OpenMower datum is discoverable at runtime by sniffing the
robot — `mower_config.sh` sets it as an env var that's exposed on the
ROS parameter server (and in `/odom_to_world_node` config), or it can
be read from `mower_logic` debug topics. **We will not auto-discover
it from the JSON file**, because the file doesn't carry it. The UI will
ask.

---

## 4. Validation rules

The importer enforces, before showing the preview modal:

1. JSON parses as `MapData`. Unknown top-level keys are tolerated.
2. There is at least one `area` with `type == "mow"`.
3. Each `outline` has ≥3 points. Polygons with <3 points are dropped
   with a per-area warning.
4. Each `outline` is finite: no `NaN`, `Inf`, or absurd magnitudes
   (`|x| > 100000` or `|y| > 100000` ⇒ rejected — sanity bound).
5. Exactly one `active` docking station. >1 → first wins, warning.
   0 → import succeeds without touching `dock_pose_*`.
6. Obstacle ↔ parent matching: every `obstacle` polygon's centroid must
   fall inside exactly one mow/nav area. Ambiguous (in 2+) → assigned
   to the first match with a warning. Orphan (in 0) → dropped, warning.

The summary returned to the GUI lists all warnings + counts so the user
can decide whether to confirm.

---

## 5. Open questions / edge cases

These are the things to weigh in on before flipping the write path
live:

1. **Datum mismatch is silent today.** The current scaffold defaults
   to "same datum" if the user doesn't supply one, which will look
   correct but plant the entire lawn 100s of metres off in the
   different-datum case. Options:
   - (a) make `om_datum_lat`/`om_datum_lon` **required** on the upload;
     UI prompts for them.
   - (b) infer from the dock — if both maps have a dock pose, derive
     the datum offset from the difference between the existing
     MowgliNext dock pose and the OpenMower one. Heuristic, but no
     extra UX.
   - (c) ship as-is and rely on the existing **Map offset** panel.
   The current scaffold leaves a TODO in `applyDatumShift`.

2. **Dock yaw convention.** Both stacks use `yaw = atan2(north, east)`,
   so the heading is portable. But OpenMower stores the heading as a
   single scalar; some early OpenMower versions stored it as a
   two-point line (`docking_pose_a`, `docking_pose_b` in the legacy
   `.bag` topic) — those need conversion via `atan2(by-ay, bx-ax)`.
   The .bag importer (§6) handles this; the JSON importer doesn't need
   to.

3. **Multiple docking stations.** OpenMower's schema supports a list,
   MowgliNext stores exactly one in `mowgli_robot.yaml`. We pick the
   first `active`, warn on the rest. If a real-world user has multiple
   docks, this needs a follow-up (likely a `dock_id` on the saved
   areas + multiple dock poses).

4. **Obstacle re-parenting on edit.** Once imported, MowgliNext stores
   obstacles per-area. If the user later moves an area boundary so an
   obstacle is no longer inside, that's pre-existing behaviour, not
   an import concern. Documented for the record.

5. **`type: "draft"` handling.** Currently dropped. Could promote to
   `mow` if the user opts in via a checkbox. Probably not worth it —
   drafts in OpenMower are almost always half-recorded sessions the
   user abandoned.

6. **Replace vs merge.** The current scaffold previews-only. When the
   write path goes live, the default action is **replace** (clear all
   existing MowgliNext areas, write the imported set). A **merge**
   mode (append OpenMower areas to existing MowgliNext areas) is
   technically just skipping the `clear_map` call — easy to add but
   risks duplicate areas.

7. **Backup before import.** Strongly recommend the GUI auto-trigger
   the existing `handleBackupMap` to stash the current MowgliNext map
   before the user confirms an import. Not yet wired.

## 6. `.bag` (rosbag2 / ROS1 bag) — design only

OpenMower's *legacy* persistence is a ROS1 `.bag` file. The current
OpenMower code includes a one-shot in-process converter
(`convertLegacyMapToJson` in `mower_map_service.cpp`) that reads three
topics and re-emits `map.json`:

| Topic                | ROS msg type                      | Maps to                    |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `mowing_areas`       | `mower_map/MapArea`               | `area.type = "mow"`, with `obstacles[]` flattened to top-level `obstacle` areas |
| `navigation_areas`   | `mower_map/MapArea`               | `area.type = "nav"`        |
| `docking_point`      | `geometry_msgs/Pose`              | `docking_stations[0]`      |

`mower_map/MapArea` is:

```
string                 name
geometry_msgs/Polygon  area
geometry_msgs/Polygon[] obstacles
```

i.e. the *exact* shape of MowgliNext's own `mowgli_interfaces/msg/MapArea`
— so once the bag is parsed, mapping is trivial.

### MowgliNext `.bag` import — three options

**(a) Tell the user to run OpenMower's converter once, then upload the
resulting `map.json`.** Zero code, but requires the user to have a
working OpenMower install. Recommended fallback.

**(b) Pure-Go bag reader.** ROS1 bag format is documented and there
are Go implementations (`github.com/aler9/rosbag-go`,
`github.com/brychanrobot/goros`, `github.com/foxglove/go-rosbag`).
None of them are well-maintained, and ROS1 message-class metadata
(`mower_map/MapArea`) would need to be hand-fed in for deserialisation.
**Effort: ~1 day, fragile.**

**(c) Python sidecar invoked by the Go importer.** The MowgliNext
container already ships ROS2 + `rosbags` Python package
(`pip install rosbags`) which reads ROS1 `.bag` and ROS2 `.db3` /
`.mcap`. The Go handler shells out to a small `import_bag.py` script
that re-emits `map.json`-shaped output, then reuses the existing JSON
import pipeline. **Effort: ~½ day, robust, single dependency
(`rosbags`).** Recommended.

For ROS2 bags (`.db3` / `.mcap`) — note that OpenMowerNext (the
ROS2 fork by `jkaflik`) records `/xbot_positioning/map` periodically;
the importer would extract the *most recent* message of that topic
and treat it identically to a `.json` import.

**Decision deferred to follow-up PR.** This iteration ships the JSON
path; the UI shows a "coming soon" notification when the user picks a
`.bag` file.
